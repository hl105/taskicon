A cute macbook menubar task tracker
## Project Description
Sometimes, you donâ€™t need to carve out time blocks on Google Calendar, you just need a simple to-do list to get through the day. Instead of opening a notes app or scribbling in the corner of your homework, this app lives right where youâ€™ll see it most: the menu bar. Itâ€™s lightweight, always visible, and comes with a cute turtle progress bar and celebratory confetti to keep you going. (Because honestly, who doesnâ€™t love confetti?ðŸŽ‰)
